Codethon challenge

#Problem description:
You are provided with a data for Indian railway trains. You will have to develop a program that prints out best route from a given source station to destination station based on 
optimized for a certain criteria.
For simplicity we are not considering the intermediate stations/arrival or departure times and your will program will purely focus on path optimizing on number of train 
switches/distance.Assume that all trains are available at any point of time by ignoring the arrival and departure times.
Your task is to develop a program that will provide the best possible route for the below questions using the given dataset.

Question #1:
Given a source station code and a destination station code, print the route with minimum travel distance.
Note:
1.	You should be able to invoke your program with source station, destination station  as parameters.
2.	Do not consider arrival/departure times at different stations and purely focus on optimizing distance.

Question #2:
Given a source station code and a destination station code, print the route with minimum travel distance & least number of train switches.

#Solution: Customized dijkstra's algorithm and provided optimum routes

#StepsToRun:

1) Run npm install
2) Run command 'node shortestPath.js' from the root folder 
3) Provide source station code , destination station code .
